# Sales-Data-Analysis-Project-Using-Power-BI

My goal in this project is to use Power BI to perform a Sales Data Analysis project using a dataset provided by the company. This will allow me to explore and extract patterns and insightful, beneficial information that managers and stakeholders can use to enhance decision-making based on data analytics and take action to improve production and result in an amazing and encouraging increase in sales.

## I have listed the tasks that must be completed in order to reach our ultimate decision and the intended result of the preferred solutions here.

. Download Power BI [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/)
. After installing on your local computer, open Power BI.

#### Now it is time to begin our Analysis.

  . Under the **Home tab**, click on **Get Data**
  . Go to **Excel Workbook.** A new window will pop out for you to select your data.


![1659324647792](https://github.com/justinjabo250/Sales-Data-Analysis-Project-Using-Power-BI/assets/115732734/43943443-ac51-40cb-9489-e03360734314)

. Upload the data provided you and check **locations, people, products** and **sales** as shown in the picture below.


![1659324626834](https://github.com/justinjabo250/Sales-Data-Analysis-Project-Using-Power-BI/assets/115732734/8c0f3eda-89e7-4f04-b1a9-56e2faa4147c)


. Since our data is cleaned and is in the format that we want, there is no need to transform data. Click on **Load** at the bottom of the window.
. We return back to our Canvas. Next, we want to create a data model between the tables.
. Go to the left side and click on the third icon as shown in the picture below.


![1659324685194](https://github.com/justinjabo250/Sales-Data-Analysis-Project-Using-Power-BI/assets/115732734/e2751cda-8b19-47bd-91f3-2e4978081252)


. The data model view opens. You see that Power BI automatically connects people and products table to your sales table.
. In your **locations** table, drag **Geo** onto **Geography** in the **sales** table to create a relationship between the two table.


![1659324713678](https://github.com/justinjabo250/Sales-Data-Analysis-Project-Using-Power-BI/assets/115732734/e312bfe2-189e-4bd6-979d-ddbab893623d)


. We have created a **star schema** where our **sales** is the fact **table** and the other tables are the **dimension tables.**
. Go back to the **report view** i.e. The first icon on top of the model view icon.


![1659324736892](https://github.com/justinjabo250/Sales-Data-Analysis-Project-Using-Power-BI/assets/115732734/d839ed38-d4f5-4ac9-beeb-1234f6a0e628)


#### 1.Visualize Sales by location

   . Click on Stacked- Bar Chart
   . Drag Geo under location table to the X-axis
   . Drag Amount under the sales table to the Y-axis

#### 2.What is the company‚Äôs Total Sales?

    . Go to the sales table on the left side of the canvas
    . Right click on **Amount** and select **New measure**
    . Type the formula **Total Sales = sum(sales [Amount])** and hit enter



![1659324785806](https://github.com/justinjabo250/Sales-Data-Analysis-Project-Using-Power-BI/assets/115732734/5cee194a-7b3f-461e-8acc-66a1088699bf)


#### A new measure with name Total sales is created.


#### 3.What is our Total Cost as a company?

    . We don‚Äôt have the cost column in our tables, so we have to create a new column for our cost.
    . Go to the data view. The second icon under the report view at the far right of the canvas.
    . Go to **Table tools** at the top and click on **New Column.**


![1659324809518](https://github.com/justinjabo250/Sales-Data-Analysis-Project-Using-Power-BI/assets/115732734/90500b07-c916-41ef-bc4f-be509e6d66e0)

   . Type the formula **Cost = sales[Boxes] * RELATED(products [Cost per box])**

   . Hit Enter and return to the report view.
   . Now repeat the steps you used to create the Total Sales measure and create **Total Cost.** The formula for this is **Total Cost = sum(sales[Cost]).**
   
#### 4.What is the company‚Äôs Total Profit?

    . Again, create a **New measure** and name it **Total Profit**
    . Type the formula **Total Profit = [Total Sales] ‚Äì [Total Cost]**
    . Create a New measure and name **it Profit%.** To calculate our **Profit%**, we divide **Total Profit** over **Total Sales.**
    . **Type Profit% = divide ([Total Profit], [Total Sales])**


#### 5.Has the Company met its Profit target?

  . Create a **New measure** and label it **Profit Target**
  . Type the formula **Profit Target Achieved? = if([Profit%] > 0.5, ‚ÄúYes‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù)**
